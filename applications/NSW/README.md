# Modelling COVID-19 in New South Wales using Covasim

The main code is in `covasim-australia/applications/nsw/`

## Usage

1. Generate a population file representing the NSW population by running `make_nsw_pop.py`. This will save a file called `nswppl.pop` to the `results` folder. NB, since results can be very large, please don't commit them to the repo. 
2. The file `run_nsw.py` can be configured to (1) calibrate the model, and (2) run scenarios. Choose which of these you want to do by setting `whattorun`. If you set `dosave = True`, the simulations will be saved to `results/nsw_{whattorun}.obj`. 
3. Run `plot_nsw_calibration.py` and `plot_nsw_scenarios.py` to load the `*.obj` files generated by the previous step and generate output plots.
