# Victoria calibration

The main script to use for calibration is `vic_calibrate.py`.

The epidemiological data used is contained in the `.csv` files located in this directory. These are sourced from
`covidlive.com.au` using `scrape_epi_data.py`. This scraping script can be run to download the latest data and
update the `.csv` files.
