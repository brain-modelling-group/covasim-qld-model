# Covasim Australia QLD

This branch `qld-calibration` is a copy of optima/covasim-australia repository, branch `analysis-merge`. 

The code here was used to produce the first batch of simulations to calibrate the agent-based model and to reproduce the epidemiological data in Queensland, from March 2020 until the first week of August 2020. 

This branch is deprecated, though functional, as of 2020-09-15. Use branch `qld-resurgence` for the latest version of all covasim QLD models.
